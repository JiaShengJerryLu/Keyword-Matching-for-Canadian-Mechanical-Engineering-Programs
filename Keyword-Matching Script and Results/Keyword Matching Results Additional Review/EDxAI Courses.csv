UofT,MSE401H1, Materials Information in Design , , ,"   This course presents approaches to composite and structural design, and optimization, for components and products. Tools for optimization, material property data analytics, and structural simulation will be used. We will apply advanced materials selection (and the CES materials database) to product and component design, and hybrid (composite) materials design. Composite mechanics theory and topology optimization will be developed for structural optimization. Finally, modern techniques including AI and machine learning will be presented for aspects of materials selection, composite design and structural optimization. Component design decisions will include both material properties and the capabilities of applicable fabrication processes, to identify the material and process which best satisfy the design requirements.
