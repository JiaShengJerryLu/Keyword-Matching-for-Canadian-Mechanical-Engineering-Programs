EPIP 403,Internship Placement III,"The Engineering Student Centre, College of Engineering will register Internship students in this 0- credit unit course for the third 4-month installment of the 12 to 16 month internship placement. This course is graded on a Pass/Fail basis."
GEOE 377,Fundamentals of Mining and Mineral Processing,"Provides the student with a basic understanding of mining engineering and the mining industry. The mining component of the course will introduce the drill and blast cycle, mining methods, and the economic evaluation of mineral properties. The mineral process-engineering component will introduce mineral separation processes including gravity, electrostatic and flotation separation."
GEOL 121,Earth Processes,Follows the same lectures as GEOL 108. The laboratory component satisfies the requirements of students in Program Type C (B.Sc. programs). Students in the College of Education who wish to take a course in Earth Science and require a laboratory component are advised to take this course.
ME 490,Design of Fluid Power Circuits,An introduction to the design of industrial and Fluid Power circuits. The operation and design of basic components are considered. A methodology to the design of industrial circuits is introduced and applied to industrial applications. Design criteria for open loop applications are introduced.
GEOL 224,Mineralogy,"Crystalline materials and their properties; crystal chemistry and chemical equilibria in natural systems; mineral properties and classification, and particularly rock-forming mineral groups; mineral genesis."
GEOL 245,Introduction to Sedimentary Rocks,"Provides a general introduction to sedimentary rocks, sedimentary processes, and the depositional environments in which these rocks form.  Stratigraphic concepts are introduced with specific reference to the relationship between sedimentary rock units.   Laboratories focus on the identification of sedimentary rocks and structures in hand specimen."
GEOL 258,Structural Geology,"An introduction to the structural features of rocks including discussions of their origin and use. The description of folds, faults, and joints are emphasized, along with outcrop relationships of intrusive bodies. Other topics will include tectonics, orogeny, stratigraphic facing, and non-orogenic process, such as salt doming and glacial thrusting. Laboratories will introduce mapping techniques and the analysis of geological maps."
CHE 453,Corrosion Engineering,Intended for engineers and others who wish to develop an appreciation of the principles of corrosion and corrosion control and their application to the selection of materials of construction and the protection of engineering systems.
GEOE 315,Rock Mechanics,Physical properties of rock. Rock stress-deformation behaviour and failure. Laboratory and in situ testing.
GEOE 380,Mine Ventilation,"This is an underground mine ventilation design course in which the theory of mine ventilation and air conditioning are presented and applied to various mine designs. Topics covered include: Saskatchewan regulations and engineering design criteria, measuring and modeling air flow in ventilation networks, calculation of head losses, ventilation system design, natural ventilation, selection of mine ventilation fans, occupational health hazards of mine gases and dusts, air heating and cooling, and aspects of the economics of mine ventilation."
ME 491,Thermal Systems Design,"A design course involving the application of the fundamentals of thermodynamics. Topics may vary depending on the choice of design project, but would typically include psychrometrics, internal and external energy gains, heating and cooling loads, duct and piping design, overall thermal design specifications and system component design and selection."
ME 492,Materials in Engineering Design,"Emphasizes materials engineering in the design process. It covers an overview of available engineering materials and their selection based on mechanical properties, surface durability and cost."
ME 493,Advanced Mechanical Design,"Deals with advanced mechanical design topics. It is considered as a continuation of Machine Design, but with an emphasis on the use of integrated design software. The course includes use of finite element and other software, such as ANSYS, SolidWorks, and MATLAB in design. One portion of the course discusses the design process and introduces the design optimization methodology and integrated design optimization software, which will be used for solving unconstrained, constrained, and multi-objective optimal design problems. The course also includes design of systems under shock and impact loading, vibration isolation and control."
ME 497,Acoustics and Vibrations in Design,"This course is an introduction to acoustics and vibrations in design. Free, and forced vibrations of systems will be examined. Applied theory includes the study of the fundamental single-degree-of-freedom (DOF) and the 2DOF systems using Newton's law of motion, the energy method, Lagrange's equations, and determination of natural frequencies, acoustics, properties, and noise standards. Design part of the course includes systems under shock and impact loading, vibration isolation and control. In addition the course will include noise control and design of mechanical systems for noise reduction. The course includes design oriented lab and assignments, and design based project."
