ME4860,Senior Design Project,"A mechanical engineering design is developed and documented in the form of a technical report. Students normally work in approved teams. Industrial projects are developed in cooperation with industry and may require some period of time on site. University-based projects are developed in cooperation with university faculty. The first stage of this process involves definition of the project topic, background studies, and development of a conceptual design. An oral examination is conducted towards the end of the first term, and a written preliminary report is submitted. In the second term, a detailed design is prepared, the project is completed and orally examined, and a final report is submitted. One of the laboratory weekly hours is designated for a scheduled meeting with project advisor(s). Workshops involve practice exercises, relevant to student projects, on: problem definition and formulation, project planning, teamwork, information and communication; conceptual, parametric and configuration designs; and professional, environmental, social, human factors, and safety aspects of design."
ENGG4000,Senior Design Project ,"Full-year design course (fall and winter of same academic year) which may be taken by senior students in any engineering program. Working preferably in multidisciplinary teams of three to five individuals, students design a structure, system, process or new product. Many of the projects are sponsored by outside clients. Proposed solutions involve the use of modern engineering tools and design methods, and must meet a broad range of constraints including health and safety, sustainable development and environmental stewardship. Deliverables include progress reports and presentations, a final report with appropriate engineering drawings, and if applicable, a prototype. Weekly lectures cover topics relevant to the design projects and include presentations by guest speakers. The weekly tutorial hours are designated for scheduled meetings with project co-mentors."
TME4025,Product Design and Development,"Full-year Product Design and Development course (fall and winter of same academic year) which may be taken in place of the final-year design course in most engineering program.

The proposed solution would use modern tools and methods for product design and development, and should meet a broad range of constraints including health and safety, sustainable development and environmental stewardship. Weekly class sessions are conducted in lecture or workshop mode and employ cases and hands-on exercises to reinforce the key ideas. Topics include identifying customer needs, concept generation, product architecture, industrial design, and design-for-manufacturing."
