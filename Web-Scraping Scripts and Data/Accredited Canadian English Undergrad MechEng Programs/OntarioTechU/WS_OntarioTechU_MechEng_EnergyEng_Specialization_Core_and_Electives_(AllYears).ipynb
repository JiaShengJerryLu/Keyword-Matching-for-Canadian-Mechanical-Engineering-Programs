It is meant to allow senior-level students to integrate their engineering knowledge and produce useful engineering artifacts. The paramount objective of the course is to expose engineering students to successfully implementing the engineering design process and appropriate engineering design methods into creatively solving design problems conditioned with realistic constraints while using state of the art engineering CAD/CAM/CAE tools and incorporating engineering standards. Another objective of the course is to train design engineering students to focus on a variety of considerations with respect to their designs, such as: economic, environmental, sustainability, manufacturability, ethical, health and safety, social, and political. Yet another objective of the course is to focus on improving the students’ soft skills that include the ability to work in teams, participate in project planning and scheduling, give presentations, and be able to deal with uncertainties in a professional manner. In this context, this capstone design course serves as one of the final preparations for students entering into industry. A wide range of engineering design-related product, process, technology, service or system development topics may be covered in this course. The course covers design considerations for systems that predominantly incorporate automotive, mechanical, thermofluids and energy, mechatronics, and/or manufacturing components and systems. This design-built project based course normally includes studying open-ended engineering design topics of interest to the students. These may consist of real-world design projects proposed and sponsored by industrial partners, or design projects on topics proposed by faculty advisors, or topics proposed by a group of enrolled students. In this context, the engineering design process will be reviewed along with its application to the design of the said systems. Students will work in small groups on a capstone design engineering project of major breadth that will require them to integrate the knowledge that they have gained throughout their program of study and apply it to the design and development of a complete device and/or a complete predominantly automotive, mechanical, thermofluids and energy, mechatronics, and/or manufacturing system. By the end of this course students will have completed the following parts of the design process for their projects: customer requirements; background search; design plan and project management; brainstorming; preliminary concept generation; sketching ideas; engineering specifications (benchmarking); detailed concept generation; functional decomposition; concept development and screening/selection; group preliminary proof of concept prototype demonstrations and oral presentations; and final engineering term report.Credit hours: 3Lecture hours: 3Laboratory hours: 3Prerequisite(s): For Mechanical (comprehensive) Engineering option students, this course requires successful completion of all program option-respective non-elective courses in third year as a prerequisite (i.e., ENGR 3360U\\xa0, MANE 3120U\\xa0, MANE 3190U\\xa0, MECE 3030U\\xa0,\\xa0MECE 3210U\\xa0, MECE 3220U\\xa0, MECE 3270U\\xa0, MECE 3350U\\xa0, MECE 3390U\\xa0,\\xa0MECE 3930U\\xa0, MECE 3420U\\xa0, MECE 4240U\\xa0).\\nFor Energy Engineering option students, this course requires successful completion of all program option-respective non-elective courses in third year as a prerequisite (i.e., AUTE 3450U\\xa0,\\xa0ENGR 3360U\\xa0,\\xa0MANE 3120U\\xa0, MANE 3190U\\xa0, MECE 3030U\\xa0, MECE 3220U\\xa0, MECE 3260U\\xa0, MECE 3270U\\xa0,\\xa0MECE 3320U\\xa0, MECE 3350U\\xa0, MECE 3420U\\xa0, MECE 3930U\\xa0, MECE 4240U\\xa0).\\nFor Mechatronics Engineering option students, this course requires successful completion of all program option-respective non-elective courses in year three as a prerequisite (i.e., ELEE 3330U\\xa0, ENGR 3360U\\xa0,\\xa0MANE 3190U\\xa0, MECE 3030U\\xa0, MECE 3210U\\xa0, MECE 3220U\\xa0, MECE 3270U\\xa0,\\xa0MECE 3320U\\xa0, MECE 3350U\\xa0, MECE 3390U\\xa0, SOFE 2720U\\xa0).\\nFor Mechatronics Engineering program\\xa0students, this course requires successful completion of all program option-respective non-elective courses in year three as a prerequisite (i.e., ELEE 3230U\\xa0, ENGR 3360U\\xa0, MANE 2220U\\xa0, MECE 2640U\\xa0, MECE 2860U\\xa0, MECE 3030U\\xa0, MECE 3220U\\xa0, MECE 3270U\\xa0, MECE 3350U\\xa0, METE 3100U\\xa0, METE 3200U\\xa0, METE 3350U\\xa0).\\nFor\\xa0Automotive Engineering program students, this course requires successful completion of all program-respective non-elective courses in year three as a prerequisite (i.e., AUTE 3010U\\xa0, AUTE 3290U\\xa0,\\xa0AUTE 3450U\\xa0, ENGR 3360U\\xa0, MANE 3120U\\xa0, MANE 3190U\\xa0, MECE 3030U\\xa0,\\xa0MECE 3210U\\xa0, MECE 3220U\\xa0,\\xa0MECE 3270U\\xa0,\\xa0MECE 3320U\\xa0, MECE 3350U\\xa0, MECE 3390U\\xa0, MECE 3420U\\xa0).\\nFor Manufacturing Engineering program students, this course requires successful completion of all program-respective non-elective courses in year three as a prerequisite (i.e., ENGR 3360U\\xa0, MANE 3120U\\xa0,\\xa0MANE 3190U\\xa0,\\xa0MANE 3300U\\xa0,\\xa0MANE 3460U\\xa0,\\xa0MANE 4045U\\xa0, MECE 3030U\\xa0, MECE 3220U\\xa0, MECE 3270U\\xa0, MECE 3350U\\xa0, MECE 3390U\\xa0).CloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseCloseClose',\n",
