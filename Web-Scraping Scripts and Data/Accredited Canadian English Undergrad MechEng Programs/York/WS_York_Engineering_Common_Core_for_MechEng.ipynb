       "['The course is designed for Engineering students interested in refreshing and expending their general chemistry knowledge while exploring the relationship between structure of matter, properties and processing. This course will focus mainly at covering important introductory concept to understand solution chemistry including reactivity, thermochemistry, structure and properties of materials. The course is divided in six sections. The first section covers an introduction to the topic of Materials Science and its impact on our daily lives as well as future trends and review key chemistry concepts required for this course. The second section will present the states of matter (gas, liquid and solid), their physical characteristics and the forces holding materials together (bonding and intermolecular forces). The third section will expend on the liquid phase and properties of solutions including equilibrium, solubility, pH and pKa. The fourth section will deal with thermochemistry and its first law with an emphasis on enthalpy as well as phase changes and phase diagrams. Section six will present an introduction to the properties of solids (electronic and mechanical) and criteria in the selection of materials will also be discussed. Section seven will present in more details structure-properties and processing of soft materials (natural and artificial polymer) in the context of the material covered in the other sections.

It uses problem-based pedagogy to expose the underlying concepts and an experiential laboratory to implement them. An integrated computing environment (such as MATLAB) is used so that students can pick up key programming concepts(such as variables and control flow) without being exposed to complex or abstract constructs.
