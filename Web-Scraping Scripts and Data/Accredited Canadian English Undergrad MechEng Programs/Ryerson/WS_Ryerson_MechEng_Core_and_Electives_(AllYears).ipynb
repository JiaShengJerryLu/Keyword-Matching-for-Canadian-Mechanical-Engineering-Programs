The course also stresses integration with other first year courses. The principal objectives of the course are to provide a general introduction to the field of engineering; to convey the social, professional, and ethical responsibilities of engineers and why they are important to an engineering education; to introduce the undergraduate engineering programs available at Ryerson University; and to provide a general description of the skills needed to become a practicing engineer. Case studies in engineering are used to illustrate engineering fields and scientific principles.</div>\n",

Exposure to public and worker safety and the impact of engineering activities on health as well as safety standards and safety codes will be covered. The course also stresses integration with other first year courses. The principal objectives of the course are to provide a general introduction to the field of engineering; to convey the social, professional, and ethical responsibilities of engineers and why they are important to an engineering education; to introduce the undergraduate engineering programs available at Ryerson University; and to provide a general description of the skills needed to become a practicing engineer. Case studies in engineering are used to illustrate engineering fields and scientific principles.'"
