Course Number,Course Name,Course Description
CHEM 1100,Introductory Chemistry 1: Atomic and Molecular Structure and Energetics,"This course provides a basic understanding of the fundamentals of chemistry. By the end of this course, students will understand the periodic table, energy in chemistry, atomic and molecular structures, and the concept of chemical reactivity. May not be held with the former CHEM 1300 or CHEM 1301."
CHEM 1122,Introduction to Chemical Techniques for Engineering 1,"For Price Faculty of Engineering students only. This course builds understanding in chemistry through active learning in the lab. By performing lab experiments, students will gain skills in making observations, safe handling of chemicals, handling laboratory equipment, quantitative analysis, data processing, and scientific communication. These skills are fundamental for student success in chemistry. In addition, students will be given a broader appreciation of chemistry in the world by introducing them to chemical sustainability, chemical responsibility and chemical applications. May not be held with CHEM 1120, the former CHEM 1310 or CHEM 1311."
COMP 1012,Computer Programming for Scientists and Engineers,"(Lab Required) An introduction to computer programming suitable for solving problems in science and engineering. Students will implement algorithms for numerical processing, statistical analysis and matrix operations. Not to be held with COMP 1010, COMP 1011 or COMP 1013."
ENG 1430,Design in Engineering,"The creative process; the design process; working in a team. The engineering profession from the perspective of students and professionals. Academic, legal and ethical considerations."
ENG 1440,Introduction to Statics,"(Lab required) Statics of particles; rigid bodies, equilibrium of rigid bodies; analysis of structures; distributed forces. Not to be held with ENG 1441."
ENG 1450,Introduction to Electrical and Computer Engineering,"(Lab required) Part I: Current, voltage, energy, potential, power Ohm's law; independent sources; capacitor, inductor, ideal diode, op-amp; Kirchoff's law; simple circuits (Resistive, RC, RL, OP-Amp; Diode); introduction to ac theory (Sinusoidal waveform, phase relations of voltage and current waveforms for R,L,C. RL and RC circuits). Part II: Applications (Digital Logic, motors)."
ENG 1460,Introduction to Thermal Sciences,(Lab required) Properties of pure substances; first law for closed systems; first law for open systems; second law; examples of power cycles and refrigeration cycles.
MATH 1210,Techniques of Classical and Linear Algebra,"(Lab Required) To introduce a variety of practical algebraic concepts and skills necessary for the study of calculus and advanced engineering mathematics. The emphasis of this course is in the development of methodology and algebraic skill necessary for successful completion of subsequent engineering mathematics courses. This course is intended for Engineering and Geophysics students only. May not be held with MATH 1200, MATH 1201, MATH 1211, MATH 1220, MATH 1300, MATH 1301, or MATH 1310."
MATH 1510,Applied Calculus 1,"(Lab Required) Functions and graphs; limits and continuity; differentiation of functions defined explicitly, implicitly and parametrically; applications of derivatives to velocity and acceleration, related rates, maxima and minima; differentials, indefinite and definite integrals, application of integration to area. Physical applications in this course make it especially suitable for students intending to take programs in engineering. May not be held with MATH 1230, MATH 1500, MATH 1501, MATH 1520, the former MATH 1530, the former MATH 1680, or MATH 1690."
MATH 1710,Applied Calculus 2,"(Lab Required) Applications of integration to volumes, centres of mass, moments of inertia, work and fluid pressure; differentiation of trigonometric, inverse trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions; techniques of integration; polar coordinates. Physical applications in this course make it especially suitable for students intending to take programs in engineering. May not be held with MATH 1232, MATH 1690, MATH 1700, MATH 1701."
PHIL 1290,Critical Thinking,"A course which helps students to think clearly and critically, and to present, defend, and evaluate arguments. The instructor will discuss good and bad reasoning, everyday fallacies, some specific argument forms such as the categorical syllogism, and ways and means of defining words. Students may not hold credit for PHIL 1290 and any of: PHIL 1291 or the former PHIL 1320 or PHIL 1321."
PHYS 1050,Physics 1: Mechanics,"(Lab required) It's rocket science! Mechanics is the science of describing (Kinematics) and explaining (Dynamics) motion. The basic concepts of calculus together with laws of conservation of momentum and energy are used to develop the tools required to describe, analyze and predict the outcomes of linear and rotational motion in simple mechanical systems. A brief introduction to the Einstein theory of special relativity provides a taste of modern approaches to this subject. This course develops a strong scientific foundation for students considering a program of study in engineering or the physical sciences. May not be held with PHYS 1020, PHYS 1021, PHYS 1051, the former PHYS 1410, or the former PHYS 1420."
