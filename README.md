# Keyword-Matching for Canadian Mechanical Engineering Programs

Three main projects contributed to the survey of the prevalence of Engineering Design (ED), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Emerging Themes at the Intersection of Both (EDxAI) in current Canadian engineering curricula:

1. Web-scraping course information (course codes, names, and descriptions) from the webites of engineering programs
2. Compiling lists of keywords from reputable sources that represented each of ED, AI, and EDxAI respectively
3. Developing a keyword-matching algorithm to look for the keywords within every web-scraped course description and to generate a list of courses whose descriptions matched with at least one keyword

The final results and scripts for each of these projects can be found in their respective folders in this repository

The keyword-matching script can be directly run on the commandline and the webscraping scripts can be opened via Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab.
